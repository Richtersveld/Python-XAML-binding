Binding data in XAML from Python

Basically I've got XAML defining a user interface with some textboxes, lets say. Then I have Python script doing some calcs in the background. I'm struggling to see how to link the data from Python into my XAML form. I've done data binding inside of the XAML form, between textboxes for example, but just cant seem to "make the connection" on how to get the external data from Python visible in the XAML. I've found some blogs on Google, but they're a bit too complicated for me to follow, and I'm just looking for a really simple (even if inefficient) way to get into this. Once I understand how the two scripts communicate I can work on the efficiencies.
